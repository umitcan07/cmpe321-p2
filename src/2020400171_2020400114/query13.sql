-- Join the MatchSession table with the Team and Coach tables by matching the team_ID and coach_username columns.
-- Return the stadium_name, name, surname, and the number of sessions directed by each coach in each stadium.
-- Filter the results to include only the coaches who directed the most sessions in each stadium.
-- Sort the result by stadium_name in ascending order, and then by the number of directed sessions in descending order.
-- Uses a subquery to determine the maximum number of directed sessions for each stadium before filtering the results to include only the coaches with that maximum count.
