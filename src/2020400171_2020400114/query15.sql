-- âœ… Query 15
-- Group match sessions by juries and then count rated sessions for each jury in a subquery. Order within the subquery by the number of rated sessions in descending order and limit the result to 1 to get the maximum number of rated sessions by a jury.
-- Then, join the jury table with the match session table and group by the assigned jury username. Filter the results to include only the juries who have rated the maximum number of sessions.
